# JPOGStegosaurus
This mod adds the Stegosaurus from the game [Jurassic Park Operation Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park:_Operation_Genesis).

> ⚠️  
> This is the second mod I made for Lethal Company. Release (v1.0.0) has the bare minimum features I think the Stegosaurus should have to function as an enemy.
> The Stegosaurus should function, but the mod is not done yet. You may experience some buggy behaviour from the Stegosaurus. I'll try and keep the mod updated and fix bugs.


## Description 📃
JPOGStegosaurus is a fully animated custom enemy that spawns outside during the daytime. With it's spiked tail it is capable of killing reckless employees and pinning them to it.

### Behaviour ▶️
- Default:
    - The Stegosaurus will peacefully walkaround
- Irritation
    - Being too close to the Stegosaurus will increase its irritation  level
    - When the irritation level of the Stegosaurus reached a certain threshold it will attack!
    - Walking behind the Stegosaurus (near its tail) might provoke a defensive response, be careful.

## Future 🎯
I would like to add more idle animations to the Stegosaurus and I am working on the Stegosaurus being able to Defend/Attack other enemies that get too close to it.
